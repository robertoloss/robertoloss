# 👋 Hi, I’m Roberto

👨‍💻 I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer based in Evans, Georgia (USA).

🛠️ My favorite tools include (among many others): Javascript, Typescript, React, Vite+React Router, Next, Tailwind, Tanstack query, Zustand, Node, Express, Drizzle, and PostgreSQL databases.

👾 I love web development and coding in general. Beyond the Javascript/Typescript family I also have various degrees of familiarity with other languages, like Rust, Golang and Lua, with which I code in my free time.

👨‍🏫 In my previous life, I was an academic and worked for 10 years as an [analytic philosopher](https://philpeople.org/profiles/roberto-loss). I held reasearch positions at various universities in Mexico (UNAM, Mexico City), Germany (Hamburg), and Spain (Barcelona and Madrid).
